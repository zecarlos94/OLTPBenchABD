Isolation -> In java jdbc connection choose one of the following:
read-uncommitted -> Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads can occur.
read-committed -> Dirty reads are prevented; non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can occur.
repeatable-read -> Dirty reads and non-repeatable reads are prevented; phantom reads can occur.
serializable -> Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads and phantom reads are prevented.
Example:
Connection c = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:odbc:MyDataSource","admin","");
c.setAutoCommit(false);
c.setTransactionIsolationLevel(Connection.TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE);
c.commit(); or c.rollback(); Depending on how successful the query was.

Atomicity and Durability -> Logs Redo,Undo,Redo-Undo; Checkpoints
wal level -> enables logs(hot_standby)
fsync -> Doesn't wait for pages to be written
synchronous commits -> informs that is finnished when in reality it hasn't
full pages writes -> If it is off may lead to db corruption
wal writer delay -> Empty all acumulated writtings in buffer
